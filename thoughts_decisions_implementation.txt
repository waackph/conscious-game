/- [Todo] Trigger to change player stuff depending on moodState
/- [Todo] Trigger to change item stuff depening on moodState
/- [Question] How to change all objects depending on moodState?
    => Maybe it is not necessary to declare different objects depending on moodState for the same entity?
    Using thoughts the capabilities to interact with the entity change. 
    But maybe it is necessary in the game to change gameObject capabilities? 
    Like having a key in depressed mode and a combinedItem in regular mode?
    => But we may say that until there is a concrete use case for it, we just make each item a
    mood dependent item, only changing its texture and managing interaction only in thoughts
